# ff

`ff` is a CLI utility to find a file using a pattern.

## Usage

Specify the pattern to look for:

`ff foo`

Check help for further options:

`ff --help`

## Why

I had an alias set up to basically do:

`find . -name [filename]`

I thought it would be fun to write a small utility to enhance this alias.
